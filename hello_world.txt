So I've spent a whole hell of a lot of time trying to understand Git.

I read articles, watched videos and all that good stuff.
Got myself to memorize the commands, understand the process trough and through.
Even went looking for help in the Odin Discord server. 
I created a cheatsheet of all the commands I leant and understood, added my own definition for it.
I felt semi competent to get to the last step of the Git_Basic part of the course.
I played around with repositories and the github to send them to. 
I finally understood a bit of it.

I managed to get myself some Doritos and a drink, get set up to finish this bit of the course and crush it.
Expecting my knowledge of the subject to barely suffice, I was wondering where I would get stuck.
But lowe and behold, the assignment was in essence what I had done before.
I managed to breeze trough it with barely reading the instructions. GGWP!

This goes to show that you sometimes underestimate yourself.
All you need is a wonder how things work, and some Doritos!
